        <p> The foreshadowing:</p>
          <p>The foreshadowing is the best of its kind. oreshadowing is a literary device in which a writer gives an advance hint of what is to come later in the story. Foreshadowing often appears at the beginning of a story, or a chapter, and it helps the reader develop expectations about the upcoming events. And this is something one peice does amazingly. </p>

        <p> Character development:</p>
          <p>The character development is also second to none. In fiction writing, character development is the process of building a unique, three-dimensional character with depth, personality, and clear motivations. You almost grow with the characters. </p>

        <p> Quality of animation:</p>
        </div>
          <p>The quality of animation is also pheonomenal. It has to be smooth. There is nothing that determines the quality of the animation more than smooth movements. The more technology is improved, the more viewers demand more from animation: they want reality. The best animation is one that captivates the fluid motions of real-life objects. </p>
